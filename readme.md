## Project 1: Nokia Snake

During this coding bootcamp we have to do 4 projects. I'm forced to do a Game as the 1st project. A popular game in my 
Generation is a Nokia Game called Snake. I'm gonna realize it by using HTML5,CSS and Javascript. 
The Game can be used in every current browser.

This repo doesn't work any more.
